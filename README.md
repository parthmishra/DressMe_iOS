Dress Me allows users to upload pictures of their clothes into the app for use in creating "outfit grids" as a way of visually representing outfits. You can then mix and match parts of the outfit by swapping items in and out.

Other features include:

* Save particular outfit grids you like to your "Favorites"
* Export a snapshot of your outfit grid to Instagram!
* Tag uploaded clothes with attributes such as color, season, outerwear, accessories, and more!
* Get recommendations of outfits based on the weather!
